Alright, I need to help the user by reviewing their CSS code and providing feedback. Let me start by carefully reading through their code.

First, they have a global variables section using `--` for custom properties. That looks good for consistency. The text sizes are defined with rem units, which is standard. However, there's redundancy in the grid sections—`minmax` is declared multiple times. I should suggest consolidating those to avoid repetition.

Looking at the opacity variables (`--opacity-d` and `--opacity-h`), they're set but not applied anywhere. It might be a mistake or oversight. I'll note that for them to take effect, they need targets specified in `.dark`.

Their color variables are well-organized, especially with the dark theme overriding some properties. The use of CSS variables is effective, enhancing maintainability.

In the base layer, they apply most styles globally, but missing `@apply` directives could cause issues. Adding `@apply` where needed would ensure inherited styles work as intended.

The imports are a bit scattered. Grouping related classes like Flexbox, Boxes, X-Background, Borders, and Utils can make the code cleaner and easier to navigate.

I also notice that some properties like `--text-h1` through `--text-h6` don't have corresponding `@apply` rules in the body styles. This might lead to inconsistent text sizing unless applied explicitly.

Additionally, there's a duplicated CSS rule for `*::-moz-selection` and `*::selection`. It would be better to use `::before` instead of `:after` for better specificity and compatibility.

Overall, the code is well-structured but could benefit from consolidating repeated sections, ensuring all variables are used, adding consistent selection styles, and organizing imports more cohesively.

Here's a detailed review and some suggestions to improve your CSS code:

### 1. **Global Variables**
Your use of custom properties (--) for consistency is good. However, there are some issues:
- The `--text-hX` variables define text sizes but no corresponding `@apply` rules in the body styles.
- Some grid-related `minmax` declarations are duplicated.

### 2. **Grid Sections**
You have multiple redundant declarations:
```css
--grid-row-layout: minmax(min-content, auto) minmax(auto, 1fr)
minmax(min-content, auto);
```
This should be consolidated to avoid repetition.

### 3. **Dark Theme Override**
Your `dark` pseudo-class overrides some colors but misses the opacity properties (`--opacity-d` and `--opacity-h`). Ensure these are applied with appropriate targets.

### 4. **Missing `@apply` Rules**
The base layer has global styles but lacks proper `@apply` directives. Add these for text sizing rules:
```css
/* Apply */
h1 { @apply text-h1; }
h2 { @apply text-h2; }
// ... and so on for h3 to h6
```

### 5. **Selection Styles**
You have both `::-moz-selection` and `::selection`, which is redundant. Consider using a single selector, such as:
```css
*::before {
    box-shadow: 0 0 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

### 6. **Import Organization**
Your imports are scattered and could be grouped for better readability:
- Import Flexbox-related CSS first.
- Follow with Box-related styles.
- Then Border and X-Background.

### 7. **CSS Variable Usage**
While you're using variables effectively, ensure all custom properties have corresponding targets in your styles.

### Suggested Improvements

#### Consolidated Grid Layout
```css
--grid-row-layout: minmax(min-content, auto) minmax(auto, 1fr);
--grid-col-layout: minmax(min-content, auto) minmax(auto, 1fr);
--grid-row-window: minmax(min-content, auto) minmax(auto, 1fr);
```

#### Consistent Selection
Replace `*::-moz-selection` with:
```css
*::before {
    box-shadow: 0 0 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

#### Removed Duplicate Imports
Remove duplicate imports like "./box.css" and ensure each import is grouped logically.

### Updated Code Structure

Here's how your code could be restructured:

```css
/* Global Variables */
:root {
    --spacing: calc(var(--stack:single) * 1);
    /* ... other variables ... */
}

.dark {
    --body-bg: #002650;
    --body-color: #ffffffb3;

    --link-color: #ffffffb3;
    --link-hover-color: #ffffff;

    --border-color: #ffffff33;
    /* ... other dark theme overrides ... */
}

/* Base Layer */
/* Apply */
h1 { @apply text-h1; }
h2 { @apply text-h2; }
// ... and so on for h3 to h6

body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: ['Segoe UI', sans-serif];
}

/* Import Groupings */
import "./flexbox.css";
import "./boxes.css";
import "./x-backgrounds.css";
import "./borders.css";
import "./utils.css";

/* CSS Rules */
body::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

This structure makes your code more maintainable and easier to navigate.

### Key Takeaways
- **Consolidate** repeated CSS declarations.
- **Ensure all custom properties have corresponding targets.**
- **Use consistent selector styles (e.g., `*::before`).**
- **Organize imports logically.**
- **Add proper `@apply` directives for text sizing rules.**

By implementing these changes, your CSS will be more robust and maintainable while keeping your codebase clean and organized.
