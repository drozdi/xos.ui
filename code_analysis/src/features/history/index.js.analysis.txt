Okay, I'm looking at this code snippet: `export * from "./Histrory";`. Hmm, that doesn't look right. First off, "Histrory" might be a typo for "History". Also, exporting using `from` is not the standard way in JavaScript or Node.js.

In ES modules, you export variables with `export`, and to access another module's exported variables, you use `import`. So instead of `from`, it should be `import`. That makes more sense here. 

So the corrected line would be something like `import * from "./History";`. I should also make sure that the path is correct and matches where "Histrory" was supposed to point.

Additionally, exporting all via `*` can lead to large files if there are many exports. It's better practice to export specific things using named exports or CommonJS `require` syntax for better modularity and efficiency.

Maybe I should change it to an ES module with named export instead. Like: 
```
export function Histrory() {
    // code here
}
```
Or, if it's a file-based module in Node.js, perhaps using `require('Histrory');` would be better for clarity and to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Also, I should check if "Histrory" is meant to be a class or a function. If it's an object with methods, exporting as default export might not capture all necessary exports, whereas named exports are more precise.

I think the main issues were using `from` instead of `import`, possible typo in module name, and improper export method. Fixing those should make the code work correctly.

The code snippet provided has several issues that need to be addressed for it to function correctly:

1. **Typo**: "Histrory" is likely a typo for "History".
2. **Export Syntax**: The incorrect use of `from` instead of `import`.
3. **Modular Exports**: Using `*` can lead to unintended side effects and should be replaced with specific exports.

Here's the corrected code:

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Fix Typo:** Change "Histrory" to "History".
2. **Correct Export Syntax:** Replace `from "./Histrory"` with `import * from './History'` using ES6 module syntax.
3. **Improve Practices:** Instead of exporting all via `*`, use specific exports for clarity and encapsulation.

**Revised Code:**

```javascript
// As an ES module (compatible with Node.js):
export function Histrory() {
    // Your code here
}

// Or, if using CommonJS:
const Histrory = require('./History');
```

If you're using a file-based approach in Node.js:

**Example:**

```javascript
// History.js
export function Histrory() {
    // ... module logic ...
}
```

Or, for named exports (ES6):

```javascript
export const history = require('./History');
```

These changes will make your module structure cleaner and more maintainable.
