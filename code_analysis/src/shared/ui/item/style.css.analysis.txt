Okay, I need to help optimize this CSS code and suggest improvements. Let me look at the code carefully.

First, I notice that there are multiple declarations for `--padding-multiplier` and `var(--indent-padding, 0rem)`. That's not necessary. I should remove the duplicate ones to clean up the code.

Next, in the hover effect, using `:hover::before` might cause issues because of name clashes with other classes. It would be better to use a pseudo-element like `:after` instead.

Looking at the transitions, there are some that aren't inherited properly. Adding `user-select: none;` and `background-clip: text-transparent` will ensure the transition affects all elements correctly.

For the `x-item--dense` class, applying `:before` and `:after` inline with `gap-1` makes it cleaner than using a nested rule for each case.

The CSS variables could be more descriptive. Renaming them to something like `inlinePaddingMultiplier` would make their purpose clearer.

I should also check for redundant declarations in pseudo-elements, especially within nested selectors, to reduce clutter and potential performance issues.

Overall, these changes should make the code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
